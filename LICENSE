Copyright (c) 2026 Sam Larson

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

1. GENERAL USE

   The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in
   all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

2. PODCAST PRODUCTION USE — MANDATORY ATTRIBUTION AND SPONSORSHIP TERMS

   If the Software is used, in whole or in part, to produce, process, edit,
   automate, schedule, or distribute any podcast, video podcast, or audio/video
   content series (collectively, "Podcast Content"), then the following
   additional terms apply as binding conditions of this license. Failure to
   comply with any of these terms constitutes a material breach of this license
   and automatically terminates the rights granted herein.

   a. VERBAL CREDIT (per episode)

      Every episode of Podcast Content produced using the Software must include
      a clear, audible, verbal statement crediting Sam Larson for the software.
      The credit must:
        - Name "Sam Larson" explicitly.
        - Reference the Cascade software by name.
        - Be spoken during the episode (not solely in pre-roll, post-roll, or
          automated segments that can be skipped).
        - Occur at least once per episode.

      Example (not required verbatim):
      "This podcast is produced using Cascade, open-source software created by
      Sam Larson."

   b. WRITTEN CREDIT (per episode)

      Every episode of Podcast Content produced using the Software must include
      a written credit to Sam Larson in the episode's published description,
      show notes, or equivalent metadata on every platform where the episode is
      distributed. The written credit must:
        - Name "Sam Larson" explicitly.
        - Reference the Cascade software by name.
        - Be visible to the audience without requiring any additional action
          (e.g., not hidden behind a "read more" fold if avoidable by the
          platform's formatting).

   c. FIRST RIGHT OF SPONSORSHIP

      Sam Larson shall have the first right of refusal to sponsor any Podcast
      Content produced using the Software ("First Right of Sponsorship"). This
      means:

      i.   Before the licensee enters into any sponsorship, advertising, or
           paid promotion agreement with any third party for Podcast Content
           produced using the Software, the licensee must first offer
           sponsorship to Sam Larson in writing (email is sufficient).

      ii.  The offer must include the same material terms (placement, duration,
           frequency, audience size, and any other relevant terms) as those
           being offered to or requested by the prospective third-party sponsor.

      iii. Sam Larson shall have fourteen (14) calendar days from receipt of
           the written offer to accept or decline. If Sam Larson does not
           respond within fourteen (14) days, the right of first refusal for
           that specific sponsorship opportunity shall be deemed declined.

      iv.  If Sam Larson accepts, the sponsorship rate shall be at fair market
           value — defined as the rate that a willing buyer and a willing
           seller, both having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts,
           would agree upon, consistent with prevailing market rates for
           podcast sponsorships of comparable audience size, niche, and
           engagement metrics. Neither party may impose terms that are
           materially above or below fair market value. In the event of a
           dispute over fair market value, the parties shall refer to the
           then-current industry standard rate cards published by reputable
           podcast advertising marketplaces (e.g., AdvertiseCast, Podcorn,
           Gumball, or their successors) for comparable audience sizes and
           categories.

      v.   If Sam Larson declines or does not respond within the fourteen (14)
           day period, the licensee is free to enter into the sponsorship
           agreement with the third party on terms no more favorable to the
           third party than those offered to Sam Larson.

      vi.  This First Right of Sponsorship applies independently to each
           sponsorship opportunity and does not expire or transfer. It applies
           for as long as the licensee uses the Software to produce Podcast
           Content.

   LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING

4. SEVERABILITY

   If any provision of this license is held to be unenforceable or invalid,
   that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible, and the
   remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

5. GOVERNING LAW

   This license shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
   of the State of California, United States, without regard to its conflict of
   law provisions.
